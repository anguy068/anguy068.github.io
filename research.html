        <p> User interviews were used in the early phases of creating my portfolio to get to know the different types of users that would be looking at my portfolio. Getting to know the types of users help me get into their thoughts and expectations, such as from a hiring manager, and what they expect to see and what I should include.</p>

        <p> The competitor analysis was crucial to contributing to my user research portion of making my personal portfolio. It allowed me to research other competitors' portfolios. I managed to find strictly competitors that were in the same field of study as mine, as I felt that would provide the most benefit in comparing what I wanted to create to what they had.</p>

        <p> The feature value matrix helped isolate the main features that I wanted to implement in my personal portfolio. After doing some primary research, I noticed certain features as being more important than others, such as: a resume link, external links leading to social and professional contacts, etc. These features were important in developing a well rounded and complete portfolio. </p>

        <p> I prioritized features that I found most important from the user interviews I conducted earlier. Some features were stressed and occurred more than others, and I valued those higher on my feature prioritization than others. Such features included: meaningful content and structure of my portfolio as the highest priorities. </p>

        <p> User stories were most useful for finding which parts of my portfolio were necessary and essential in maintaining. It helped isolate which sections, content, features provided the best feedback and were deemed necessary in the successfulness of the portfolio website. Conducting the user stories helped me pinpoint the ideal features and content that a potential future employer would need to see on my portfolio in the hiring process.</p>

        <p>The main purpose of conducting the cognitive walkthroughs was to get in the "shoes" of the users navigating my portfolio website. The walkthrough allowed me to follow along, through each individual step, of the user when they had to navigate through a certain section of the portfolio, or if they were trying to achieve a certain goal. An issue that was brought to my attention through conducting the cognitive walkthroughs was certain aesthetics of my website and how they could be improved, such as the navigation bar being formatted to stretch atop the entire webpage. </p>

        <p>The user tests that I conducted for my portfolio website were: a navigation test and five-second feedback test. The reason I wanted to conduct a navigation test was because I wanted to see given a user and a certain set of instructions, if my portfolio website was easily navigated or there would be issues. Upon receiving my results, I found that certain parts were left ambigious. When asking the user tester to find my resume on the page, I had a high failure rate because most selected the "about" tab to go to my resume, rather than the "contact" section. The reason I chose to conduct the five-second feedback test was to which additional features needed to be added to my website to help improve its content.</p>

        <h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="summary_text">Prior to conducting these user research and user testing requirements for building my personal portfolio, I had no idea how much planning was necessary prior to actually creating the portfolio. Planning out the content and getting feedback from different users was one of the most important steps I felt in this project. Knowing your "audience" and what should be expected was definitely pivotal in creating my portfolio. To me, I had a general idea of what features were important to me, but after conducting so many different research tests, there were features I did not even think of incorporating into my website, but later added them as a result of these research tests.</p>
        <p class="summary_text">After adding features and creating the basic "skeleton" of my website, there would be more additional features that my user test results would want to be added to my website content. The process initially was tedious to keep up with how many different features were to be expected or recommended, but planning it out beforehand helped overall. Actually implementing the features into my website was also a small challenge I encountered when creating my portfolio website. I may have submitted my website as a finalized product, but to me, a website can never actually be "finished." It is always an ongoing project that can be improved over time.</p>

        <h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="inc_text">The feedback received from my many differnt user test results were key in helping me improve my website overall. The importance of the cognitive walkthroughs and user tests helped get a different perspective on viewing my portfolio. This would initially lead to me determining to develop a simple and general website layout, with very little designs, colors. </p>
        <p class="inc_text">For example, while conducting the cognitive walkthrough, I had users make comments on some features on my website such as the navigation bar and how it should generalized like other navigation bars and stretch the entire screen of the webpage. Another observation made during one of my cognitive walkthroughs was the color of some text on my website. Initially, I wanted to keep the website a simple and clean design and use colors sparingly. However, the one element of color I used within my website was in some title portions with red text. An observation made and suggestion was that the color red can sometimes be associated with "anger" and a harsh color. This never occurred to me when I chose the color initially and I felt that a change would be best. The user suggested I change it to a softer color, such as a light blue. </p>
        <p class="inc_text">Overall, these observations and findings helped improve my website from its inital creation. There were suggestions from the user test results such as adding more content in my "about me" section which I plan to add. I initally did not want to add too much text as I felt potential employers would not have the time nor the patience to read through large walls of text reading about me. I felt they would only want a quick glimpse into my life and just learn a little about me.
